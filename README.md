# DockerUbuntuPython37 A simple Docker image script to build VIM from sources
with Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 18.10

This image was created as part of an answear for a Stack Overflow question
(https://vi.stackexchange.com/a/18509/11384).

__Disclaimer__: I'm not a VIM, Docker ou Linux specialist. I wouldn't have been
able to do anything like this without the help of the pages above. And,
probably, I didn't do it _the right way_, so use this `Dockerfile` with care!
